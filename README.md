# History Prefs Modifier

## What's this?

If you change some default preferences in the "Privacy" pane via MCD or etc., then you'll expect that the "Firefox will:" list box become "Use custom settings for history". However, Firefox always set the list box to "Remember history" even if some history preferences are turned off.

This addon forces Firefox to set the list box to "Use custom settings for history". That's all.
This is mainly designed for corporate-use.
